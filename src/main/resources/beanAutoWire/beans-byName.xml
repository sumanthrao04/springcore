        <!--
 What happens:

Spring looks for a bean with id = address because Employee has a property named address.

If found → automatically injects it.

 If your bean was named addr instead of address, auto-wiring would fail silently → address property remains null.

 Use Case:
When property names and bean ids are always consistent (e.g., employee has address → bean id = address).
